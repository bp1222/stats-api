  summary: Retrieves a person's stats
  description: >
    Returns stats for a person (player) by ID. Use query parameters to request
    stat types (stats=gameLog,statSplits,statsSingleSeason), group (e.g. group=hitting
    for batting stats, group=pitching for pitching stats), and season (e.g. season=2022).
    Splits and stat keys vary by group (hitting vs pitching).
